## Introduction
4th Year software development student working on developing skills related to AI, machine learning, and Data Science.

## Background
This portfolio will present technologies and tools which I am familiar with and what I am currently working on learning. To showcase areas which I am best suited for in a professional project development environment.

- Machine Learning: sklearn, SMOTE

### Personal/College Projects
#### Project 1 - Loan Default dataset
- **Data Sources** - [KaggleDataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default) , this is a high quality dataset from kaggle, featuring approx 250k rows. It contains info about customers and whether they defaulted on their loans or not. This data has a 10.0 usability score on Kaggle. Meaning it is well presented and will likely need minimal Preprocessing
- **Data Preprocessing** The dataset appeared to be high quality with no obivous missing data or errors. To confirm this the pandas library was utilised.
